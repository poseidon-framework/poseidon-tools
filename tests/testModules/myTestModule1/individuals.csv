12881A,HINX,HINX-HS1,"SK 241",Tooth,1300,1150,"Middle Anglo-Saxon","UK_Saxon","Buried within a shallow oval grave cut into the top of a major boundary ditch, skeleton 241 was that of a middle aged/old female placed in a crouched position. This individual measured 158.6 cm in stature. Ante mortem tooth loss had affected the two lower mesial incisors only, and this unusual position may indicate that an occupational use of the teeth, or perhaps trauma, had resulted in their loss. Other dental conditions included caries and periodontitis. Osteoarthritis was present on some joints, while evidence of Schmorl's nodes and metabolic disease (cribra orbitalia) was also observed.",""
